# Creator

Creator is a small Proof of concept for building a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) Editor in Vue.js. It does not support many elements, but basic operations like drag and drop, resize and rotate for simple rect elements.
I think it should be easy to extend the functionality by adding more shapes or adding more properties to existing shapes.
